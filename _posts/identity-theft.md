## **WHAT IS IDENTITY THEFT**

Identity theft is an extremely common form of cybercrime in the United States. According to the Federal Trade Commission, around nine million Americans experience identity theft yearly. However, what exactly does it mean to have your identity stolen, and how do criminals do it? It's natural to think of our identity as people the attribute that's make up a person - what someone looks like, their race, their values, what makes them laugh, etc. However, this is not the Nicholas Cage and John Travolta movie *Face Off*, the criminals don’t physically take what you presume to be your personal Identity. Rather, according to the Federal Trade Commission, identity theft occurs when someone achieves access to another person's Social Security number, credit cards, debit cards, or other specific personal information, and in turn uses those things to open new accounts, make purchases, or get a tax refund. Essentially, the criminal steals financial and governmental information from another person.

## HOW DOES IDENTITY THEFT OCCUR

### Identity theft is extremely common because of how easy it is to do. There are multiple different types of identity theft each requiring different methods of crime

These are the types of Identity Theft involving technology:

> **Skimming:** This occurs when a person uses their credit/debit card and the reader device collects information from the magnetic strip on the back of the card.                                                                                     Prevention: Check bank statements frequently and use cash more often

> **Pretexting:** This occurs when a scammer contacts the victim under a false pretext urging the victim to give them personal information like their SSN, credit/debit card number, bank routing number, answers to security questions, etc. The criminal will create a new identity often posing as a company or person that the victim would trust by calling the victim and asking certain questions.                                                                             Prevention: **VERIFY YOUR SOURCE!** This is the number one way of preventing fraud from happening to you. Always, always, always check to make sure the email or phone number is directly associated with the person or company before giving any personal information.

> **Phishing Schemes:** The Federal Trade Commission defines Phishing scams as "Scammers use email or text messages to trick you into giving them your personal information. They may try to steal your passwords, account numbers, or Social Security numbers. If they get that information, they could gain access to your email, bank, or other accounts.
